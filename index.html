		    <p>The light ball follows the movement of your mouse with an exaggerated movement.</p>
		    <p>WASD moves the cube in the direction pressed - up, left, down, or right, respectively.</p>
		    <p>Keys 1 and 2 control the x-direction rotation speed of the cube, and keys 3 and 4 control the y-direction rotation speed.</p>
		    <p>Z and X move the light ball closer or further away from you, respectively. C resets its position relative to you to its original position.
